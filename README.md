## GYM

![alt text](https://github.com/EssamMohamedAbo-ElMkarem/Reinforcement-Learning-in-a-nutshell/blob/main/images/gym.jpg)
Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.

Gym documentation website is at https://www.gymlibrary.ml/, and you can propose fixes and changes to it here.

## Stable Baseline3

Stable Baselines3 (SB3) is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. It is the next major version of Stable Baselines.
